Bugs and Limitations
====================
While we strive to keep ZPyWallet as bug-free as possible, sometimes errors do slip in. Here are a list of things that are currently not supported by ZPywallet:

**Bugs:**

- No reproducible library-wide bugs are currently documented here. Known limitations are listed below.

**Limitations:**

- ``Destination`` amounts are stored internally as integer sats or wei, and you can now pass raw units by setting
  ``in_standard_units=False`` when constructing them.

  Floating-point arithmetic before you construct the ``Destination`` can still introduce caller-side rounding errors. For example,
  if you calculate 0.1+0.2 in floating point, you will get 0.30000000000000004, not 0.3. This issue particularly affects Ethereum
  amounts since it uses 18 decimal places. In order to avoid this pitfall, use Python's ``Decimal`` class and convert the floating-point
  values to strings first before doing arithmetic, like this:

  .. code-block:: python

      from decimal import Decimal
      a = 0.1
      b = 0.2
      amount = float(Decimal(str(a)) + Decimal(str(b)))

  For more information about this error which is prevalent in most programming languages, see `Floating Point Math <https://0.30000000000000004.com/>`_.

- ZPyWallet cannot send coins from script hashes eg. P2SH, P2WSH addresses.

- Multisig is not supported.

- P2WPKH-P2SH is currently not supported.

- Timelocks are currently not supported.

- In the case of Ethereum, contract addresses are not officially supported. Interaction may not work.
